# Excel File Preview: User Guide

## What's New

The Data Catalog now allows you to preview Excel files directly in your browser, just like CSV files. This makes it easier to check the contents of Excel spreadsheets without having to download them first.

## How to Preview Excel Files

1. Navigate to a dataset that contains Excel files (files with .xlsx or .xls extension)
2. In the Files section, click the "Preview" button next to any Excel file
3. The preview page will display:
   - The first 10 rows of data in a table
   - File information including size and upload details
   - Number of rows and columns in the file
   - Column headers/names

## Features

- **Quick View**: See the first 10 rows of data instantly
- **Column Headers**: All column names are displayed as badges
- **Row Count**: See the total number of rows in the file
- **Download Option**: Still have the option to download the full file if needed

## Supported File Types

- Modern Excel files (.xlsx)
- Legacy Excel files (.xls)

## Tips for Best Results

- **Simple Spreadsheets** preview better than complex ones
- For **multi-sheet Excel files**, only the first sheet will be displayed
- **Formatting** (colors, cell styles, etc.) is not preserved in the preview
- **Large files** may take a moment to generate the preview

## Need More?

If you need to see more than the preview shows:

1. Use the "View in Browser" button for a 5-hour link to view the file in your browser
2. Use the "Download File" button to download the full Excel file to your computer
